			Over a ten week course, our team of three designed and created Super Ninja Bros using Unity and writing C# game scripts. 
			Player choice was a core mechanic so that those with different play styles could find unique methods to complete the game.

			Originally, we intended to create a morality system where players would have to weigh the pros and cons of defeating enemies, and choosing to do 
			either would affect the type of skills and rewards available. Ultimately, we chose to implement different skills that the player could choose at 
			the end of the level. Combat skills assist with taking down enemies, while stealth skills are helpful for avoiding enemies and traversing the level.

		<div class = "procedures_text_2_snb">	
			One of my roles on the team involved designing and implementing the stealth skills. The stealth skills that you can obtain in the game are the dash, 
			which lets you dash forward quickly on ground or midair; the smoke bomb, which allows you to be undetected by enemies for a short while; and the choke 
			hold, which allows you to incapacitate enemies for a short time.
