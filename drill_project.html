			As my main project during my internship at Optum – UnitedHealth Group, my partner and I were 
			tasked to find efficient alternatives for querying on Optum’s Data Lake. Current querying 
			procedures on Apache Hive ran upwards of hours for some commonly used join queries.  
			Over the course of this project, I developed my proficiency in writing SQL queries as 
			well as my communication within a larger corporation.

			The Data Lake is home to billions of user records, and the querying system at the time – Apache 
			Hive – was inefficient with these large queries. After researching alternatives such as Apache Pig 
			and Apache Spark, we concluded that Apache Drill would be the most beneficial tool. We wrote over 
			90 SQL queries in both Hive and Drill to compare their performances. Though we mainly focused on 
			JOIN queries, we tested on all of the SQL features listed below.

			We concluded that Drill performed better than Hive on memory intensive tasks like JOIN or ORDER BY 
			queries. Drill successfully ran these queries in 1/7th the time that Hive did, yielding time-efficient 
			and accessible data to users.
